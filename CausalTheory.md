## Lesson 1: Causality Defined
```diff
For centuries philosophers and scientists have considered the meaning of causal reasoning. In Plato’s Timaeus it is written “everything that becomes or changes must do so owing to some cause; for nothing can come without a cause”. Since then, many philosophers including David Hume and Immanuel Kant have made contributions the concept of cause, which ultimately can be separated into two dominant conceptions:<br>
> 1)	Aristotelian interpretation: Causes are the active initiators of change
> a.	A is the cause of B means A initiates change in B
> 2)	Scientific interpretation: Causes are inactive nodes in a law-like implication chain
> a.	A is the cause of B if, given the occurrence of B, A must have occurred
<br>
**‘Causality, causation, or cause and effect’**, is the influence of one process/state on the production of another process/state where the cause is partially responsible for the effect, and the effect is partially responsible for the cause, and generally a process has several causes.
<br>
**‘Causal inference’** is the process behind determining the effects of a phenomenon within a larger system. The most effective way to determine the causal effect is through the use of randomized controlled trials (RCT). As RCT are costly and complex, and in some situations may be impossible to perform. When an RCT cannot be performed a natural experiment/observational study may provide inference. 
<br>
**‘Causal analysis’** can be thought of as the practice of applying experimental design and statistics to establish cause and effect. There are usually four elements: correlation, a sequence of cause before effect, a plausible mechanism for an effect to follow the cause, the ability to eliminate common or alternative causes (special causes). Causal analysis can be performed by observational studies, but due to issues such as confounding, quasi-experimental approaches using statistics require assumptions to produce ‘good’ estimates with observational data.
