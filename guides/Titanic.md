Propensity Score Matching can be used as a quasi-experimental method for causal analysis. The process is to split the sample into a treatment group and a control group. We then estimate the probability, based on covariate/confounder values, of an observation belonging to either the treatment or control group (without considering the outcome). These scores are generated by fitting a regression. Methods of calculating propensity scores include logistic regression or gradient boosting. If using logistic regression, categorical features must be converted to dummies.

Our goal is to match similar propensity scores (predictions of receiving treatment based on covariates) between the treatment and control group. After matching, the distribution of our covariates should be very similar. We then take the standard mean difference of outcomes of the treatment group and the control group to estimate the average treatment effect (ATE). Using the Titanic dataset we will explore the effect of being in 3rd class on survival.
